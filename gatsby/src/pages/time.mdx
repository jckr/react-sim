# How Time Works

Time is one of the central notions of `react-sim`.

A react-sim `Model` will maintain:

- `tick` (integer), a representation of the progress in the simulation,
- `data` (anything), the internal state of the data to be shown,
- `isPlaying` (boolean), a flag that controls whether the animation is running or not.

In addition to these main properties, `Model` also maintains:

- `cachedData` (object), which caches data which has already been calculated for a given `tick`,
- `results` (array), where information on the previous runs of the simulation can be stored.

The simulation author is expected to pass properties such as:

- `initialParams` (object), a list of params for the simulation. They can be overridden by the [controls](/controls).
- `initData` (function), which takes `params`as input and outputs the first value for `data`.
- `updateData` (function), which takes: `params`, `data`, `tick`, `cachedData`, and `results` as inputs, and outputs a new value for `data`.

# The simulation lifecycle

## Initial state

When a `<Model />` is created it will:

- initiate the interal `params` from the values of `initParams`.
- initiate `tick` - either through the `minTime` or the `initialTick` prop. `minTime` takes precedence.
- run `initData` and generate a first value for `data` from the `params`.

The [frames](/frame) will not render until `initData` has run, but they will render once `data` has been initialized once.

If the `isPlaying` prop of the `<Model />` is set to true, it will start `playing`. Else, the simulation doesn't change until [controls](/controls) trigger it.

## Playing

When the simulation is playing, every so often it will try to update `data` and refresh the `Frames`.
By default, the simulation refreshes 60 times per second.

It's possible to make it go slower by providing a `delay` prop to `Model`. The simulation will wait that long (in ms) to refresh the animation.
Each time the animation refreshes, the simulation will progress by 1 tick (i.e. the `tick` value will increase by 1.)
It's also possible to make it go faster with a `ticksPerAnimation` prop. If this value is greater than 1, then the simualtion will try to update `data` that many times before re-rendering `Frames`.

We can use both values at once. For instance, we can have a simulation that, every 100ms, updates 500 times.

### Playing stops if:

- the user _pauses_ or _stops_ the simulation,
- `ticks` reaches the maximum value,
- the simulation _completes_.

When the simulation _pauses_, `isPlaying` simply switches to false. Nothing else changes, `tick` stays the same, so does `data`, etc.
The [default timer](/controls/default-timer) provides an easy way for a user to trigger a `pause`. Model has an internal method that pauses, which can be exposed to controls.

When the simulation _stops_, `isPlaying` switches to false, but data is also re-initiated:

- `tick` goes back to its original value,
- `initData` fires again and overwrites `data`,
- `cachedData` is emptied,
- `results` is left unchanged.

The simulation _completes_ when `updateData` triggered a condition where it can't go any further.
When this happens:

- `isPlaying` switches to false, but:
- `tick` is unchanged,
- `data` is unchanged,
- A `result` for this run may be appended to `results`.

The simulation won't reset unless manually triggered.

### When to update or cache data

Each time `tick` changes, `data` is updated.
If using cached data, and `tick` changes to a value for which `cachedData` has precomputed values, then the simulation will simply retrieve those values and not do further calculations.
This can happen, for instance, if a user uses the time slider to move back in time.

Else, we're going to figure out which is the latest value of `tick` for which we have data, and through how many cycles do we have to go to get to the current value of `tick` - which can be just 1 if tick is simply incrementing along the animation, but which could be more if `ticksPerAnimation` is set, or if we are moving foward in time with the time slider, and run `updateData` as many times as needed.
`updateData` will stop running if:

- `tick` reaches the maximum value, or
- the simulation _completes_.

Each time it successfully runs, if caching data, it will update `cachedData`.

If a simulation is never going to complete, and has no maximum time value, and there's no reason to go back in time, then it may be a good idea to disable caching, as the system will eventually run out of memory. You can do that by setting the `noCache` property of the `Model` to `true`.

### Updating data

Updating data is done through the `updateData` function, which takes as arguments an object with the following properties:

- `data`: the existing `data`,
- `tick`: the next value of `tick`,
- `params`: all the `params` of the simulation,
- `cachedData`: the cached values of `data` for previous ticks,
- `results`: the results of previous runs,
- `complete`: a function that signals that the simulation is complete. If it's provided an argument (result), that is added to the `results` property of the simulation.

`updateData` will return an updated value for `data`. Even if it completes, it's expected to return `data`.

The main idea behind `updateData` taking the existing `data` as an argument is that it can operates as a mathematical sequence.

For example, in the following Fibonacci spiral example:
<Fibonacci />

the `updateData` function is a very simple recursion:

```jsx
function updateData({ data, tick }) {
  if (tick === 0) {
    return [0];
  }
  if (tick === 1) {
    return [0, 1];
  }
  const lastNumber = data[tick - 1] + data[tick - 2];
  return [...data, lastNumber];
}
```

But `updateData` has access to other properties of the simulation, and can use past values of data, or even information on previous runs of the simulation, as needed.
`updateData` can also not use any of these arguments and provide values unrelated to the previous state of the simulation.
