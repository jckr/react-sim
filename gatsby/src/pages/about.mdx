Title: what is React-Sim?
---

React-sim is a framework for building simulations using React.

A React-Sim simulation is composed of a _Model_, which keeps track of internal data and time, and one or several _Frames_, which renders the data as it changes.

To create a simulation, we define:
- how data will be initialized,
- how data will be updated, at each step of the simulation,
- how the Frame will render that data,
- what controls are needed.

All the boiler plate code is taken care of.
