Title: what is React-Sim?

import { ChillBoids } from '../components/examples/boids';

React-sim is a framework for building and rendering simulations using React.

Simulations may have:

- a data model, with rules to initialize it and update it,
- a way to render them visually,
- logic to animate the model over time,
- a UI to let a user control it.

`react-sim` lets developers work on all of these things separately and provides building blocks to get the common tasks out of the way.
