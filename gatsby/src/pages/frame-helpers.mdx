Title: Frame Helpers
---

Frame helpers are building blocks to help you create frames quicker.
You 100% can build Frames without them but they make certain patterns in Frames easier.

They are similar to the [pre-defined types](./controls/pre-defined-types) for [controls](./controls).

The Frame Helpers are:

- [Grid](./frame-helpers/grid),
- [CanvasFrame](./frame-helpers/canvas-frame)
- [TimeSeries](./frame-helpers/time-series)
- [Counter](./frame-helpers/time-series)
- [Indicator](./frame-helpers/time-series)

To use a Frame Helper in your project, import it from `react-sim`:

```jsx
import { Grid, CanvasFrame, TimeSeries, Counter, Indicator } from 'react-sim';
```

Frame helpers are already connected with the Model, so if you use a Frame helper anywhere within a Model, it will receive the following props from that Model:

- cachedData,
- data,
- initData,
- params,
- results,
- tick,
- setData

It's also possible to get the corresponding component, i.e. without these props automatically provided by the Model.
Just add Component to your `import`:

```jsx
import {
  GridComponent,
  CanvasFrameComponent,
  TimeSeriesComponent,
  CounterComponent,
  IndicatorComponent,
} from 'react-sim';
```
