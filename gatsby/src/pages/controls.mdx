# Controls

Controls is how a user can interact with the simulation:

<Image name="modelControls" />

React-Sim provides 2 ways to build that interface.

- A "fast" one, by passing certain props to a `<Model />` component. You have access to building blocks to create a controls UI, styled sensibly, with minimal effort.
- a "custom" one, using a wrapper. You bring in the component you want, styled the way you want, wrap it in `withControls` and it will have the methods and information needed to interact with the simulation.

**TL;DR**: by default, your `Model` will come with a [default timer](/controls/default-timer) control that lets user start, stop, reset and go step by step in a simulation. That default timer stops at 100 ticks.
