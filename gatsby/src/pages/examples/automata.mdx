# 1D Automata

<Automata />

[1D cellular automata](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html) are among the simplest of automata.
Each line consists of a series of cells which are either set (colored) or not.

At each tick, we use a rule to determine whether cells on the next line will be set.
For each new cell, we consider the three cells above. There are 8 possible combinations - each of these cells can be set or not (so 2x2x2).
For each of these combinations, the rule determines whether the cell should be set or not. So we have 2<sup>8</sup> rules, or 256.

You can select a rule by adjusting the slider, or by clicking on each of the bits.

This simulation is an interesting example of [custom control components](/controls/custom-controls)
