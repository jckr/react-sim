### Caveat

The purpose of this model is just to show how simulations work in React. It has no scientific value.

This epidemic simulator is inspired by the work of [Harry Stevens at the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/).
Again, this react-sim version was made without any scientific supervision and the parameters are just put in so it can look interesting.

We have a number of agents moving in a small space. When they collide, "sick" agents may contaminate "healthy" agents, and "sick" agents may die.
