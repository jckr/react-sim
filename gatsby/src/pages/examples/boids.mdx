<Boids />

[Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) is one of the best-known agent simulations in computer graphics.

A number of boid agents move in a plane and their movement is governed by three forces:

- alignment: they try to move in the same direction than the boids around them,
- cohesion: they try to move towards the average position of boids around them,
- separation: they try to avoid other boids around them.

The boids movement is reminescent of that of flock of birds.

In our implementation, each of these forces can be parameterized: the coefficient is how much this force affects the boid's movement, and the radius is the maximum distance at which neighboring boids are considered.
