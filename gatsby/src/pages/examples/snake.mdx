<Snake />

This model tries to win the game of [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>).

A snake moves on a 2d grid. It can go straight, turn left or right. If it hits the borders of the grid or a part of its body, the game is over. If the snake eats a fruit, it grows in size. The goal of the game is to eat all the fruits, until the snake covers the entirety of the grid.

The way the model works is by finding a circuit which is safe for the snake to use. If we can find a circuit that covers the whole grid, then the snake can loop on that circuit endlessly and never collide with anything else than with a fruit.
How do we find such a circuit? We start by finding the _shortest path_ between the head and the tail of the snake. Then, we see how we can extend this path step by step. This other model shows how this works:
