# Fibonacci sequence

Both of these examples are inspired by the Fibonacci sequence, where:

- F<sub>0</sub> = 0,
- F<sub>1</sub> = 1,
- F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n - 1</sub> + F<sub>n - 2</sub> for each n > 2.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

<FibonacciNumbers />

The corresponding `udpateData` function is as follows:

```jsx
function updateData({ data, tick }) {
  if (tick === 0) {
    return [0];
  }
  if (tick === 1) {
    return [0, 1];
  }
  const lastNumber = data[tick - 1] + data[tick - 2];
  return [...data, lastNumber];
}
```

F<sub>n</sub> / F<sub>n-1</sub> converges to φ, the golden ratio - (1 - √5) / 2.

Because of this convergence, the Fibonacci sequence is sometimes associated with spirals.
We could:

- draw a square of side F<sub>n</sub>, then
- draw a square of side F<sub>n+1</sub> to its right, then
- draw a square of side F<sub>n+2</sub> below these two squares, then
- draw a square of side F<sub>n+3</sub> to the left of these squares, then
- a square of side F<sub>n+4</sub> above,
  etc, etc.

and by linking their corners, obtain a [Golden spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral).

But we can also draw a Golden Spiral without even needing to initiate or update data.

We can start from a rectangle φ \* k by k rectangle, divide its longer side by φ, draw that square, and keep on dividing the remaining rectangle.
We'll have squares of same proportions and can also draw a similar spiral.

All we need is the number of steps we want to go (tick) and a Frame to render the squares and spiral.

```jsx
const FibonacciSpiral = () => (
  <Model initialParams={{ size: 500 }} delay={100} maxTime={20}>
    <FibonacciSpiralFrame />
  </Model>
);
```
