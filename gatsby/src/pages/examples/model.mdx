# A simple model

<SimpleModel />

This model just shows how the various parts of react-sim work together.
100 cells are arranged on a grid from top-left to bottom-right. A cell is black if its number is less than the current tick.

This model doesn't have a `initData` or an `updateData`, it just works with the value of the `tick`.
