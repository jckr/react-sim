# Model

## Import

```
import {Model} from 'react-sim';
```

## State

- data (any): represents the current state of the simulation.
- tick (integer): a measure of time in the simulation. Each time the simulation updates, ticks increases by one.
- params (Object): the parameters of the simulation.
  The difference between `data` and `params` is that `data` is being updated at each simulation tick, without user intervention, through the `updateData` function, whereas `params` is only modified when the user interacts with the [controls](/controls).
  The built-in parameters are:
  - delay (number): delay between animation refreshes in miliseconds.
  - maxTime (integer): the value of `tick` at which the animation stops.
  - minTime (integer): the value of `tick` when the animation starts.
  - ticksPerAnimation (integer): the number of simulation ticks per animation refresh. If more than one, the simulation will update several times before it's rendered again.
- isPlaying (boolean): whether the simulation is running or not.

- results (any): is updated each time the simulation finishes, and contains information on the past runs.

## Properties

- initialTick (number, optional, default 0): the initial value for `tick`.
- initalParams (object, optional): the initial value for the `params` of the simulation. When the simulation starts, it is used to populate `params` in the state.

The following properties can be used as is, or be passed inside `initialParams` i.e. `<Model delay={100} />` or `<Model initialParams={{delay: 100}} />`.
`initialParams` takes precedence if both are used. They provide an initial value for the corresponding parts of the state.

- delay (number, optional, default 0): the delay between each animation refresh. If not specified, animations happen as fast as possible (up to 60 times per second).
- minTime (integer, optional, default 0): the value of `tick` when the animation starts.
- maxTime (integer, optional, default 100): the value of `tick` at which the animation stops.
- ticksPerAnimation (integer, optional, default 1): the number of simulation ticks per animation refresh. If more than one, the simulation will update several times before it's rendered again.

- isPlaying (boolean, default false): whether the simulation plays automatically or not. If this is updated by external components, the simulation will stop or resume.
- loop (boolean, default false): if set to true, the simulation restarts whenever it's stopped playing.

- nocache (boolean, default false): if set to true, the simulation won't cache its data. If data is cached, then the user can go back in time without having to recalculate data.

- controls (control object, optional): describes the UI of the simulation. Controls is how the `params` in the state can be modified.
- noControls (boolean, optional, default false): if set to true, the default controls won't be shown.
- showTimer (boolean, optional, default true): if set to false, the default timer won't be displayed.
- showTime (boolean, optional, default true): if set to false, only the play, stop and step-in button will be displayed, the slider and the indication of time won't be shown.
- showTimerSlider (boolean, optional, default true): if set to false, the timer slider won't be displayed, though the indication of time may be.

  For more information on controls and the syntax of the control object, see [Controls](/controls).

- initData (function, optional): the function that initializes the `data` of the model, when it first starts or when it's reset.
  It takes `params` (in the state) as input, and outputs a value for `data` (which it puts in the state).
- updateData (function, optional): this function updates the `data` at each tick of the simualtion.
  Its arguments are of the form:
  ```({cachedData, complete, data, params, pause, stop})```. Its output will replace `data` in the state.

  In the arguments:
    - `data` represents the current value of data.
    - `tick` represents the new tick.
    - `params` represents the current parameters.
    - `cachedData` is an object so that for each past value of `tick`, `cachedData[tick]` represents the value of `data` at that moment of the simulation.
    - `complete` is a function that signals the simulation is complete (it will also stop).
    - `pause` is a function that will stop the simulation from automatically updating and animating.
    - `stop` is a function that will stop the simulation from automatically updating and animating, and will reset it.
