# How does it work?

At the core of a React-Sim simulation is the `Model`.

<Image name="model" />

The `Model` maintains three key pieces of information:

<Image name="modelState" />

- `params`, parameters of the simulation which don't change without a user intervention,
- `tick`, a measure of the progression of the simulation, which may increase automatically over time, and
- `data`, data for the simulation which will be updated at each new tick.

<Image name="modelComponents" />

To make a simulation work, the model has to interact with several other parts of the simulation:
- `controls`, which will handle how users interact with the simulation,
- `initData`, which is run at the beginning of the simulation, to create the initial dataset,
- `updateData`, which is run each time the `tick` changes,
- `frame`, which will render the simulation for each tick.

Let's see how they work.

## Controls

<Image name="modelControls" />

Controls let users interact with the simulation. Through `controls`, users can play or pause the simulation, when applicable, jump to a point in time, or control the parameters.

Controls enable developers to describe a UI for these interactions, using things like sliders, textboxes, toggles etc. (or bring your own).

Controls get to change both the `params` and the `tick` inside the `Model`. Controls can't access or change the `data` though.

## initData
<Image name="modelInitData" />

`initData` generates the dataset at the start of the simulation. It can read the model's `params`, and replace its `data`.

## updateData
<Image name="modelUpdateData" />

Each time the `tick` changes, `updateData` will generate a new dataset, as a function of:
- the existing `data`,
- the `params`,
- the value of the `tick`.

## frame
<Image name="modelFrame" />

The `frame` is how the simulation is going to represent the data.
From the `Model`, it reads:
- the current `data`,
- the current `tick`,
- the `params`

and it uses that to render the simulation. Anything that can be rendered by React can go into a Frame - canvas, HTML content, SVG, you name it.

<Image name="modelHighLevelView" />

So that's how the Model and the other components interact at a high level.
