# Custom controls

<CustomControlExample />

_A custom control example_

Don't like the predefined control types? Want more control on controls? no problem.

You can import `withControls`, and wrap any arbitrary component with it.

## withControls props

When you do that, you expose this component to the following props:

- isPlaying (boolean): tells your custom control if the simulation is playing.
- params (object): any and all of the simulation parameters.
- pause (function): call this function to _pause_ the simulation (it stops playing, but is not reset.)
- play (function): call this function to start or resume playing the simulation.
- stop (function): call this function to stop the simulation (stops playing, time is reset to default, data of simulation is reset.)
- updateTime (fuction): call with a number to update the `tick` value in the simulation.

## Custom controls use cases

- do your own styling
- position controls how you see fit relative to the `Frame` (not just below)
- combine `Frame` and `Control` - the same component can render the simulation and change its parameters.

```jsx
import {withControls, Model} from 'react-sim';

const MyControl = ({ params, setParams }) => (
  <input
    type="range"
    value={params['my-param']}
    onChange={e => setParams({ 'my-param': Number(e.target.value) })}
  />
);

const CustomControl = withControls(MyControl);

/* ... */

const CustomControlExample = () => (
  <Model showTimer={false} initialParams={{ 'my-param': 50 }}>
    <Flex flexDirection="column">
      <CustomControl />
      <MyFrame />
    </Flex>
  </Model>
```
