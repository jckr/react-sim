Title: Pre-defined types

# Pre-defined control types

If you want more than the default timer, the next simpler way is to pass a `controls` property to your `Model`.

By doing so, you can use one or more of the _pre-defined control types_.

These control types are:
- [Checkbox](/controls/checkbox)
- [Input](/controls/input)
- [Toggle](/controls/toggle)
- [Radio](/controls/radio)
- [Select](/controls/select)
- [Range](/controls/range)
- [Timer](/controls/timer)

The `controls` props can be:
- an object, in which case you are specifying a single control, or
- an array, which is how you can [arrange controls](/controls/arranging-controls)

# Common props

All controls, except the `Timer`, have the following props -

- type: (one of 'checkbox', 'input', 'radio', 'range', 'select', 'timer' or 'toggle', 'timer' by default) - defines the kind of control we're describing
- param: (string) The name of the parameter in params that will be changed by this control,
- label: (string) The description of this control in the UI. If left blank, `param` will be used.
- name: (string) The name of the control. If not specified, `label` will be used.
- sx: (object) All controls are created with [rebass](https://rebassjs.org), and can take `sx` props.
