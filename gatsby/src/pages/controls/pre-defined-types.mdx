# Pre-defined control types

If you want more than the default timer, the next simpler way is to pass a `controls` property to your `Model`.

By doing so, you can use one or more of the _pre-defined control types_.

These control types are:

- [Checkbox](/controls/checkbox)
- [Input](/controls/input)
- [Toggle](/controls/toggle)
- [Radio](/controls/radio)
- [Select](/controls/select)
- [Range](/controls/range)
- [Timer](/controls/timer)

The `controls` props can be:

- an object, in which case you are specifying a single control, or
- an array, which is how you can [arrange controls](/controls/arranging-controls)

# Common props

All controls, except the `Timer`, have the following props -

<CommonControlsPropsAPI />
