`Time Series` is a [frame helper](./frame-helpers) with which you can plot some changes in your data object during your simulation.

<TimeSeriesExample />

In this example, we are throwing 2 dice 100 times, and we are plotting the average value of the roll during the process.
We are also looking at the distribution of the rolls.

## Series parameter

`TimeSeries`, `Counter` and `Indicator` all rely on a parameter called `series`.

`TimeSeries` and `Counter` can take either an array of series or a single series, `Indicator` only takes a single series.
