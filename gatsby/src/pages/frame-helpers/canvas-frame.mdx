`CanvasFrame` is a [frame helper](/frame-helpers) that makes it easier to use canvas with react-sim.

It's used in many of the examples such as [Chaos Game](/examples/chaos-game), [Percolation](/examples/percolation)) [Epidemic simulation](/examples/epidemic), etc.

# CanvasFrame properties

Its properties are:

<CanvasFrameAPI />

# the draw function

The `draw` function does all the heavy lifting.

Its argument is an object with the following properties:

<DrawAPI />

`circle` and `roundRectangle` are helper functions to make it easier to draw circles and rounded rectangles with canvas.

Both take an object as argument with the following properties:

<CircleAPI />

<RoundRectangleAPI />

so for example, you can have a `draw` function that would go like this:

```jsx
const draw = ({ctx, data, circle, params}) => {
  const {height, width} = params;
  ctx.clearReact(0, 0, width, height);
  data.forEach(d => circle({x: d.x, y: d.y, 2}));
  ctx.fill();
}
```
