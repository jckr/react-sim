|Name|Description|

|__data__<br/>any|Represents the current state of the simulation.|
|__tick__<br/>integer|A measure of time in the simulation. Each time the simulation updates, ticks increases by one.|
|__params__<br/>Object|The parameters of the simulation.|
|__isPlaying__<br/>boolean|Whether the simulation is running or not.|
|__results__<br/>any|Is updated each time the simulation finishes, and contains information on the past runs.|

The difference between `data` and `params` is that `data` is being updated at each simulation tick, without user intervention, through the `updateData` function, whereas `params` is only modified when the user interacts with the [controls](/controls).

The built-in parameters are:

|__delay__<br/>number|delay between animation refreshes in miliseconds.|
|__maxTime__<br/>integer|the value of `tick` at which the animation stops.|
|__minTime__<br/>integer|the value of `tick` when the animation starts.|
|__ticksPerAnimation__<br/>integer|the number of simulation ticks per animation refresh. If more than one, the simulation will update several times before it's rendered again.|
