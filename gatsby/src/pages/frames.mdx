Title: Frames
---

# How frames works

The `Frames` are the part of the simulation in charge of rendering the internal state.

Given a `data` and a `tick` prop, the `Frames` paint a view of that information.

When the `Model` refreshes the animation, it sends updated `tick` and `data` to the `Frames`, so the `Frames` rerender and show fresh information.

The `Frames` only job is to render the data. `updateData` does the calculation on the data, the `Model` manages the animation and [controls](/controls) let the user interact with the Model.

This is a completely declarative approach, consistent with the React approach.

# How to connect Frames and the Model

The `Frames` receive some information from the `Model`.

- `data` (anything), the current state of the simulation.
- `tick` (integer), the progress in the simulation.
- `params` (object), all the parameters set by the user/author, which don't change over time without intervention.
- `cachedData` (object), data from previous `ticks` of the simulation, and
- `results` (array), data from previous completed runs of the simulation,
- `initData` (function), the Frame can reinitialize data,
- `setData` (function), the Frame can change the data. (so for instance the Frame can be used to let the user enter an initial state of data).

The `Frames` can be one or more components.

The easiest way to connect `Frames` to a `Model` is just to have these components as children of the Model:

```jsx
<Model>
  <MyFrame />
</Model>
```

A component which is a direct child of `Model` will receive all of the props above from `Model`.

This also works if there are several children:

```jsx
<Model>
  <MyFrame />
  <MyOtherFrame />
</Model>
```

All components will receive these props. The children will be arranged from left to right.

However, it doesn't work if the components are deep into the tree, ie:

```jsx
<Model>
  <div>
    <MyFrame />
  </div>
</Model>
```

Here, `<MyFrame />` won't receive the frame props, because it is too deep.
To connect `Frames` deep in the tree, we can use the `withFrames` wrapper.

```jsx
import { withFrames, Model } from 'react-sim';
import MyFrame from 'my-frame';

const MyConnectedFrame = withFrames(MyFrame);

export default () => (
  <Model>
    <div>
      <MyConnectedFrame />
    </div>
  </Model>
);
```

Here, `<MyConnectedFrame />` receives the `frames` props.
